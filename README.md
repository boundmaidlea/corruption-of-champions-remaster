# Readme

This is gonna be a Complete rewrite of CoC as a Desktop app, based on NW.js.

It will include content/features of some mods for the original CoC, and major changes of my own regarding flow of gameplay and style of game, and major expansion to the content of the game, both in dialog or interactions with existing characters, as well as potential entirely new characters or locations.

This is not gonna be finished soon, as i am working on this alone, and i'm rotating between different projects all the time.
